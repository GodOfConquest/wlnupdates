I would like to suggest that in the list of series, you have ways of sorting the series by popularity, by rating, by editor's choice (your personal favorites), by state of completion, stuff like that. 

I would also suggest that in the list of all the novels, next to the series, you have their state of completion and the last chapter translated. So it would read like "Akikan - Incomplete - Chapter 243/9000" or whatever.
